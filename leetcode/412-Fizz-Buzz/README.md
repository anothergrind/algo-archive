# 412. Fizz Buzz

**Difficulty:** Easy

[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/)

## Problem

Given an integer `n`, return a string array `answer` (**1-indexed**) where:

- `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if `i` is divisible by 3 and 5.
- `answer[i] == "Fizz"` if `i` is divisible by 3.
- `answer[i] == "Buzz"` if `i` is divisible by 5.
- `answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`

## Solution

See [`code.py`](code.py).

Allocates a list of the numbers `1` through `n`, then walks it and overwrites every slot
with the string it should hold. Because the array is 1-indexed in the problem but
0-indexed in Python, each position `i` is checked against `num = i + 1`. The combined
case is tested first as `num % 15 == 0`, which is the same as being divisible by both 3
and 5; the remaining branches then only have to check one divisor each.

- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(n) for the returned array
